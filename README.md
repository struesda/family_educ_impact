# family_educ_impact

Project for Introduction to Data Science class.

Question to be answered:
- Will certain family factors affect their educational approaches?  (specific factors and outcomes TBD?)

Data to be used:
- Parent and Family Involvement in Education study from National Center for Education Statistics
- https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp

What do I know about the data so far?
- I have reviewed the Data File Users Manual - including the survey questions, and have noted some questions of interest.

Why did I choose this topic?
- I have been working in the education sector for 25 years and am interested in education outcomes.  As a parent who has chosen
  to homeschool - I am also interested in how other families have chosen to approach education and how that is related to other family 
  factors - as well as educational and workforce outcomes.
